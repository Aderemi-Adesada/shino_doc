   usage

**Shino** is a blender project management and version control addon, that helps you manage your files and projects.
Shino helps reduce the stress of organizing your files manually which is prone to error, while working on my personal
projects In blender I found out that I spend almost 40% of my time searching for files, so I created shino to solve that problem. 

Shino also helps you version your files so when you have an idea you can always try it out without worrying about losing your old
or duplicating your file, shino also makes reusing assets from other projects easy, it also keeps track of the time you have spent
on a file/project and how it cost which can help you when billing your clients.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
the :doc:`installation` process of the addon.

.. note::
   This project is under active development.
