2. Ensure the latest zips are downloaded
----------------------------------------------
Latest can be downloaded from the marketplace of origin. (top file is always the latest)

.. important::
    Do not unzip the downloaded files. Then install the addons (.zip files) as explained below

This only works if the folder is not there already! Otherwise... issues.

In the addon panel locate Shini and Remove it, then you are able to install the newer update.
